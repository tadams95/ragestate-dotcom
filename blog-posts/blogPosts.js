    p2: "I'll keep this blog short since I'm not much of a writer and there's other parts of the website/brand that I should definitely be working on. \
     In regards to the wbsite, I'll keep tweaking the design so it's more consistent and user-friendly. This includes the mobile version of the site. \
     I'll also be adding more content to the site. This includes more blog posts, more products, and more features. \
     Additionally, I do need to make some improvements to the mobile app.",

    p3: "Lastly, it's not likely RAGESTATE will ever hold physical merchandise anymore. I'm not a fan of the logistics of it all. \
      We went ahead and donated the remaining inventory to a local charity. \
      If you follow us on Instagram, you'll see where the donation was made. \
      Thanks for reading and stay tuned for more updates.",

    p2: "I've been thinking a lot about how to level up the RAGESTATE brand. As a solopreneur, it's easy to get overwhelmed with ideas and ignore advice. \
     I'm gonna try to focus on actually doing things instead of just thinking about them. \
     Let's explore what I have in mind below.",

    p3: "I've realized that I have all the tools I need for a killer marketing campaign. It's just a matter of putting them together in the right order. \
      For example, I want more people to visit my website. But why? Right now, users can basically just shop, look at a dummy event, and create an account. \
      That's not very exciting. I feel like some animations and chat functionality between users would make the site more engaging.",

    p4: "One thing I want to do is drive more traffic to the products page so people can download the RAGESTATE app. \
    The app works, but I need to make it faster and them push the updated version to the app store. \
    That might take a couple weeks so I need to be efficient with my time.",

    p5: "Since the last blog post, I have made some improvements to the website. It's code is cleaner and the design is more consistent. \
    The pages load faster and the mobile version is more user-friendly. \
    And data is pre-rendered now so users can input URLs directly into the browser and still see the content.",
    p6: "My plan for the rest of the year is to start running ads Q4 and keep them running while I improve the website and app. Stay tuned for more updates.",
