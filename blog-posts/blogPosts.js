      p1: "Welcome to the RAGESTATE blog. If I was a bigger yapper, there'd probably be more blog posts here but since this is the first one you're gonna have to bear with me. ", // Add more paragraphs
      p2: "I'll keep this blog short since I'm not much of a writer and there's other parts of the website/brand that I should definitely be working on. \
     In regards to the wbsite, I'll keep tweaking the design so it's more consistent and user-friendly. This includes the mobile version of the site. \
     I'll also be adding more content to the site. This includes more blog posts, more products, and more features. \
     Additionally, I do need to make some improvements to the mobile app.",
  
      p3: "Lastly, it's not likely RAGESTATE will ever hold physical merchandise anymore. I'm not a fan of the logistics of it all. \
      We went ahead and donated the remaining inventory to a local charity. \
      If you follow us on Instagram, you'll see where the donation was made. \
      Thanks for reading and stay tuned for more updates.",
