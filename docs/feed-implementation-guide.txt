RAGESTATE FEED IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
===================================

This guide outlines the steps to create a social feed for RAGESTATE, leveraging 
the existing Firebase infrastructure. The feed will allow users to post content,
like and comment on posts, and view a personalized timeline.

1. FIRESTORE DATABASE STRUCTURE
-------------------------------

Create the following collections in Firestore:

- posts
  - postId (document)
    - userId: string (author ID)
    - userDisplayName: string
    - userProfilePicture: string
    - content: string (post text)
    - mediaUrls: array (optional images/videos)
    - mediaType: string ('image', 'video', null)
    - timestamp: timestamp
    - likeCount: number
    - commentCount: number
    - tags: array (optional)
    - isPublic: boolean
    
- postLikes
  - likeId (document)
    - postId: string (reference to post)
    - userId: string (user who liked)
    - timestamp: timestamp
    
- postComments
  - commentId (document)
    - postId: string (reference to post)
    - userId: string (commenter ID)
    - userDisplayName: string
    - userProfilePicture: string
    - content: string
    - timestamp: timestamp
    - likeCount: number (optional for comment likes)

- userFeeds
  - userId (document)
    - postIds: array (references to posts to show in feed)
    - lastUpdated: timestamp

2. FIREBASE SECURITY RULES
--------------------------

Add these rules to protect your feed data:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Posts - users can read public posts, create their own, edit own
    match /posts/{postId} {
      allow read: if resource.data.isPublic == true || resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      allow update, delete: if resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    // Likes - users can read, create their own, delete own
    match /postLikes/{likeId} {
      allow read;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow delete: if resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    // Comments - users can read public post comments, create their own, edit/delete own
    match /postComments/{commentId} {
      allow read;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update, delete: if resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    // User feeds - users can only access their own feed
    match /userFeeds/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
  }
}
```

3. CREATE REACT COMPONENTS
--------------------------

The feed UI will require several components:

A. components/feed/FeedContainer.js
   - Main container for the feed
   - Handles post loading and pagination

B. components/feed/CreatePostForm.js
   - Form for creating new posts
   - Media upload functionality

C. components/feed/PostCard.js
   - Individual post display
   - Like and comment interactions
   - Media preview

D. components/feed/CommentSection.js
   - Comment display and creation
   - Nested comments if desired

E. components/feed/FeedFilter.js
   - Options to filter feed content (latest, trending, etc.)

4. IMPLEMENT FIREBASE FUNCTIONS
------------------------------

Create the following Firebase functions to support the feed:

A. processNewPost
   - Triggered when new post is created
   - Update follower feeds
   - Process media (generate thumbnails, etc.)
   - Extract hashtags and mentions

B. updateFeedCounts
   - Triggered when posts are liked/commented
   - Updates counters atomically

C. notifyMentionedUsers
   - Send notifications when users are mentioned
   - Add post to their feed

D. scheduledFeedRefresh
   - Periodically update user feeds with relevant content
   - Remove old/stale content

5. IMPLEMENT CORE FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------------

A. Post Creation
   - Add text entry form
   - Media upload and preview
   - Post submission to Firebase

B. Feed Display
   - Realtime feed updates using Firebase onSnapshot
   - Infinite scroll pagination
   - Pull-to-refresh

C. Post Interactions
   - Like/unlike posts
   - Comment on posts
   - Share posts

D. User-specific Feeds
   - Show posts from followed users
   - Include suggested content

6. OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES
-------------------------

A. Pagination
   - Use Firestore's limit() and startAfter() for efficient loading
   - Initially load 10-15 posts, then load more as needed

B. Caching
   - Cache feed data locally
   - Use service worker for offline access

C. Lazy Loading
   - Lazy load images and videos
   - Defer loading comments until expanded

D. Denormalization
   - Store duplicate data (like usernames) to avoid excess queries
   - Keep counters (likes, comments) on posts to avoid counting on-the-fly

7. IMPLEMENTATION ORDER
----------------------

Phase 1: Basic Feed
   - Setup Firestore collections and security rules
   - Create post creation form
   - Implement basic feed display
   - Add like functionality

Phase 2: Enhanced Interactions
   - Add comment functionality
   - Implement media uploads
   - Create user profile integration
   - Add basic notifications

Phase 3: Advanced Features
   - Add hashtags and trending topics
   - Implement post sharing
   - Create personalized feed algorithm
   - Add feed filters and search

8. TESTING STRATEGY
------------------

A. Component Testing
   - Test individual feed components with mock data
   - Verify like/comment functionality works

B. Integration Testing
   - Test feed with real Firebase backend
   - Verify realtime updates work properly

C. Performance Testing
   - Test with large datasets
   - Verify scroll performance remains smooth
   - Measure and optimize load times

9. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
---------------------------

A. Privacy Settings
   - Allow users to create public/private posts
   - Control who can comment on posts

B. Content Moderation
   - Implement reporting system
   - Create admin tools for content review

C. Analytics
   - Track post engagement
   - Measure user retention via feed

D. A/B Testing
   - Test different feed layouts and ranking algorithms
   - Optimize for engagement

10. MAINTENANCE PLAN
-------------------

A. Regular Security Reviews
   - Check Firestore rules regularly
   - Update permissions as needed

B. Performance Monitoring
   - Monitor Firebase quotas and usage
   - Optimize queries that become slow

C. Content Growth Strategy
   - Plan for database scaling
   - Consider sharding strategies for large post volumes

Remember to leverage your existing user authentication and profile system 
to integrate seamlessly with the new feed functionality.
